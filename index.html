                This attribute declares the page's character encoding. It must contain a standard IANA MIME name for
                character encodings. Although the standard doesn't request a specific encoding, it suggests:

                Authors are encouraged to use UTF-8.
                Authors should not use ASCII-incompatible encodings to avoid security risk: browsers not supporting them
                may interpret harmful content as HTML. This happens with the JIS_C6226-1983, JIS_X0212-1990, HZ-GB-2312,
                JOHAB, the ISO-2022 family and the EBCDIC family.
                Note: ASCII-incompatible encodings are those that don't map the 8-bit code points 0x20 to 0x7E to the
                0x0020 to 0x007E Unicode code points)

                Authors must not use CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1 and/or SCSU as cross-site scripting attacks with these
                encodings have been demonstrated.
                Authors should not use UTF-32 because not all HTML5 encoding algorithms can distinguish it from UTF-16.
                Notes:

                The declared character encoding must match the one the page was saved with to avoid garbled characters
                and security holes.

                The title element represents the document's title or name. Authors should use titles that identify their
                documents even when they are used out of context, for example in a user's history or bookmarks, or in
                search results. The document's title is often different from its first heading, since the first heading
                does not have to stand alone when taken out of context.
